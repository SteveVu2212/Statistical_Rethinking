# Abstract

It is a market design project that focuses on studying optimal strategies and learning processes of economic agents in credence markets. The markets are prevalent in industries of healthcare, car repair, financial advice, insurances, etc. It is where sellers are experts and take advantage of asymmetry information by possibly providing fraudulent treatments while buyers have a little chance of finding out such distrust behavior.

In the project, rating or reputation operates as a matching mechanism. Buyers arrive stochastically and rate their satisfaction about served services and directly impacts sellers’ future profit. Sellers aim at maximizing long-term profits by creating reliable reputations, learning and updating strategies. There are two bottom-up approaches to the project, including Monte Carlo simulation and Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning.

The main research finding is that sellers are more eager to provide unfair services via insufficient treatments or overcharging as the penalties are relaxed. The penalties are a combination of probability that an under-treated product fails, probability that buyers find out being overcharged, and a weighing factor stating the importance of historical ratings into buyers’ decisions on selecting sellers to be visited.
