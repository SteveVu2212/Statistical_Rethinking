# Introduction

I see the project as my stepping stone to Bayesian inference. It has walked me through a whole process of fitting a probability model to a set of data and summarizing the result by a probability distribution on the parameters of the model and on unobserved quantities such as predictions for new observations.

The project includes two parts:
* The first part covers most of exercises over 16 chapters in an incredible book, [Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). It really helps me to construct and reinforce my viewpoints of essential characteristics of Bayesian analysis by practicing on various problems from  constructing and analyzing **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)**, setting up **full probability models** to handling **measurement errors** and imputing **missing data**.
* My most favourite part is the second one which is highlighted by three things:
  * It generates comprehensive case studies that inherit different causal questions from the textbook such as the evaluation of the prosocial tendencies of chimpanzees or the technological evolution in the island societies of Oceania.
  * It is motivated by and follows the [Bayesian workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808) by Gelman et al. (2020).
  * Its models are written in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org), a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling.

# Disclaimer

Here is the most important thing. The materials and resources being used in the project belong to the textbook **Statistical Rethinking** by **Richard McElreath**. I credit the book to strongly inspire me to *rethink* my viewpoints of statistics.
